A shooting game loosely based on the events that occur during Revolutionary Girl Utena. Consists of a main player who can move left and right and also shoot bullets, and an enemy character who doesn't move but can also shoot bullets. Code is adapted from a tutorial for a shooting game on youtube.

Originally looked like this:

Enemy/Player is eliminated when health reaches 0 after being shot. The player can also play/pause the music. Once an ending is reached, the music is paused automatically for the 2 different endings to play.
